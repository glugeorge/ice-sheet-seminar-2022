# Agenda, week 7


## 1. shear strain
 ending with the final bit of tensor notation

## 2. mass balance

### 2.1. Simple derivation



### 2.2. More complicated derivation, from $\nabla \cdot \underline{u}$




### 2.3. Apply to simple cases

#### rigid open-ended pipe in full-pipe

#### closed rigid pipe (Q=0)

#### closed deformable pipe (toothpaste tube)

#### flat ice sheet 

#### sloping ice sheet with flat bed

#### wedge ice sheet

#### ice shelf (most general)



## stress balance equations 
Probably wont have time for this
